This work is about a reverse Polish calculator that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrimaG/GrimaG.github.io/tree/master/Calculator) folder also contains the [class diagram](https://github.com/GrimaG/GrimaG.github.io/blob/master/Calculator/ClassDiagram%20Calculadora%20polonesa%20reversa.asta) of the project and the [use case diagram](https://github.com/GrimaG/GrimaG.github.io/blob/master/Calculator/UseCase%20Calculadora%20polonesa%20reversa.asta).
The calculator was modeled and organized according to the MVC pattern.
Was not found model as an example to interface diagram in the software, so I couldn't add.
The project collaborates with learning in the discipline by means of weekly work therefore is not designed for the end user. Contact me send an email to: gustavo.gcampello@gmail.com
