the work involves the creation of a factory and an abstract factory ships. They were created two abstract factories ships, one for ships carrying people from type Cruise and Schooner, and another factory that produces ships carry cargo and people, types of cargo and bulk.  And the factory method, which receives the kind desired by pa√¢metro and creates the ship using the abstract factory. The Class diagram is in portuguese/english sorry for this.

*Means Navio = Ship, Fabrica = Factory, Cruzeiro = Cruise, Esccuna = Schooner, Carga = Cargo and Graneleiro = Bulk.
